Fly Run
fly, run, fly
there, there where time is water
you know you can be
worried by the sea of emotions

sea, the sea, the sea of emotions
I'm with you in this sea
sea, the sea, the sea of emotions
I will continue to breathe in the ocean of emotions
wow wow oh wow?

wow oh oh wow
sea of emotions..

And I, I know
I know about the facts
What's in this wonderful ocean
I'll find them in you
There, among the fish of the sea and snakes
The marvelous ocean of emotions

emotions, feelings, ocean of emotions
It is always and ever in me.
