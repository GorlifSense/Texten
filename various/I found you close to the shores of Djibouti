Fly Run
fly, run, fly
there, there where time water
you know you can
worried about a sea of emotions

sea, the sea, the sea of emotions
I'm with you in this sea
sea, the sea, the sea of emotions
I will continue to bathe in the ocean of emotions
wow wow oh wow

wow oh oh wow
sea of emotions..

And I, I know
I know about the fact
What's in this wonderful ocean
I'll find you
Thee among the fish of the sea and snakes
The marvelous ocean of emotions

emotions, feelings, oyshen of emotions
he is ever ever in me.
